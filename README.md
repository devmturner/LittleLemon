This is my capstone project for the Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate through Coursera. This project brings together the most important aspects of what I've learned through the courses in this certificate program in the form of a back-end built for a fictional restaurant called Little Lemon.

This project features:
  - Django web framework with usage of REST API created in a virtual environment
  - Token Authorization
  - models for booking a table and menu items connected to a MySQL database
  - Using gitbash to push commits
